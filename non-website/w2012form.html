It's TripAdvisor meets github meets choose your own adventure. We are crowdsourcing walking tour creation in cities. Users can build, share, fork, rate, and follow tours (from their phones). At any given point in a city, the user will be in the middle of, or at least near, many different walking tours. Users will be encouraged to branch out of their tour if they’re bored, or just hungry.

We want to help people experience a city like a local and avoid the tourist traps, without spending hours researching hundreds of places and building an itinerary themselves.

The data we collect about real-world user behavior will be interesting to mine. We will eventually be able to use data about where people actually go, which tours get completed, and use 3rd party APIs like Google places and foursquare, to build and recommend better tours.</textarea></td></tr>

Steven - In college I built an autonomous robot that chased after soccer balls using embedded C and a bluetooth link to a desktop running MATLAB for image processing. I machined custom hardware and soldered (often under a microscope) most of the boards.

Devin - I completely changed the way most 3rd party merchants visualize, manage and explore their sales data on Amazon by building an interactive data visualization library in JavaScript from from the ground up (by myself). The library is now being integrated into various teams across Amazon who need a fun and interactive way to display important chronologically-based data.

Josh - Working on the core visual and motion design team, I was responsible for redesigning the visual and interactive experience of the upcoming version of Excel.

Steven came up with a scheme to artificially raise his girlfriend’s quality score with her employer, using a flaw in their quality control process. His girlfriend recently started working for a medical transcription company. She is required to maintain a 99% accuracy rate, which is determined by random audits of old documents and submissions of new documents to be reviewed immediately. Soon after starting work, she was told she was submitting too many documents for review. In order to fix this, she only submitted transcripts with which she had the most trouble. Obviously, this dropped her accuracy rate below 99%. After discussing the problem with Steven, he brought up the fact that because she’s required to submit her worst transcripts for review, the quality calculation isn’t a true random sample, and can thus be manipulated. He figured out that she can simply average the documents that have been reviewed, find the necessary additional quality needed to bring up the total average, and submit just enough correct transcripts until the average passes the required threshold. After several weeks, there have been no more complaints from her boss.</textarea></td></tr>

We have not worked together on a project before Tourious.

Steven met Devin through a mutual friend who he met at a Reddit board game night in Seattle about a year ago and have been friends ever since. Recently, Steven pitched the idea for Tourious to Devin over drinks at their favorite local bar, and Devin was immediately taken by the idea. We’ve spent all of our free time for the past few weeks working together on the idea.

Devin and Josh have been friends since meeting through a mutual friend six months ago. Being impressed both with Josh’s programming and, more importantly, design skills, Devin brought him onto the project after an informal discussion where they realized they were both trying to build a similar system independently.

Steven met Josh about three weeks ago when Devin introduced them and Josh was brought onto the project.</textarea></td></tr>

</td></tr><tr style="height:5px"></tr><tr><td><textarea cols=60 rows=20 wrap=virtual name="exp">
We picked this idea because all of the founders have gone to a foreign city and, despite having looked hard for things to do before arrival, didn’t know what to do once they got there.

We have never developed in the travel space before, but we all love to travel. All three founders have been programming for over a decade, and we all have experience launching and running websites.

We know people need what we’re making because we need it. We’re scratching our own itch, and have met many other people with the same problem. It is frustrating, not to mention time consuming, to check wikipedia, yelp, tripadvisor, guidebooks, etc., only to be overwhelmed with irrelevant information for mediocre places. If you lurk on a city subreddit for a couple weeks, you'll see many people asking the same question: "I'm visiting for x days, what should I do?" We want to make that question easier to answer.</textarea></td></tr>

The idea of city tours, that the user can fork, created by people who actually live in the city, available on any phone, is new.

Currently people have to either: build their own tours by researching for countless hours and hoping they picked the right things to see, find a tour guide and spend a bunch of money for an inauthentic experience, or amble about a city hoping to find something cool.</textarea></td></tr>

We have no direct competitors since nobody is doing walking tours, but the following are all close: TripAdvisor, Gowalla, Wikitravel, Yelp!, Google. We fear Gowalla most, since they've just recently re-launched with a new interface and features, and already have a great community. Gowalla is the only company we've found that's beginning to encroach on this space. They do have city tours, however they aren't organized logically, are hard to sort through, and are mostly tourist traps.</textarea></td></tr>

</td></tr><tr style="height:5px"></tr><tr><td><textarea cols=60 rows=17 wrap=virtual name="get">
People don't want to spend time planning a trip. Our competitors focus on independent points of interest, which presents too many options and requires too much effort; we link these points together to match how people actually travel. Traveling is best done by visiting a series of places on a great route, not by visiting independent points.

Our closest competitor, Gowalla, has a lot of features that detract from the actual experience of being in a new place. They want you to check in, collect digital items other users have left in that location, etc, all of which keep users tied to their phones. They want you to stay in their application. We want to get you somewhere and get out of the way.</textarea></td></tr>
<tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td>How do or will you make money?  How much could you make?
      (We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)
</td></tr><tr style="height:5px"></tr><tr><td><textarea cols=60 rows=29 wrap=virtual name="money">
We will make money in several ways:
* Paid advertisements from local businesses appearing along the route users follow (and we can even track if users physically go to the business!).
* Using APIs from companies like ThinkNear.com, which promotes businesses at certain times of the day, depending on when they need demand, from which we would take a referral fee.
* Professionally managed walking tours, like a segway tour, which a tour company has paid to list. (This might detract from the image of “made by locals” that we’re trying to project, so we probably wouldn’t do this.)
* Referral fees from hotel/flight booking websites (think hipmunk’s vices map combined with tour routes)
* Sponsored routes (Tom Douglas wrote a book recently that is about walking tours in Seattle that go to famous sights and --shock!-- his restaurants. We can do the same thing for other business owners.)
* $20 city packs, when traveling internationally since you won't want to pay the crazy international data charges.

The tourism industry is huge, grossing over $100 billion annually in the US alone. Based on the millions of potential users, getting above $50mm of gross revenue after 3 to 5 years is not unreasonable. Our biggest competitor, GoWalla, has raised over $10mm in the last three years, and other competitors like Yelp! are valued at over $200mm.</textarea></td></tr>

Yelp grew by throwing parties for “elite” members -- those who wrote many high-quality reviews for the site. We can do the same for our own elite members, who would also be featured on vic.tourioushq.com sub domain.

We can promote on travel blogs and other niche sites like eater.com. We will let users share routes via twitter and facebook. We can watch twitter for keywords (travel, tripadvisor sucks, yelp...) and respond with a suggestion to use our service, though this is in danger of being seen as spam. We can also send out stickers to ‘featured’ places along popular routes that merchants can put in their windows.

We can overcome the chicken-and-egg problem by offering points and gift cards (and badges, or t-shirts) to the first 1000 people to create a walking tour in a city. We can also just seed the initial routes ourselves.</textarea></td></tr>

Version control for news. After moving from print to digital media, there is no longer a hard record of news. All of us have had the experience of sending an article to a friend, only to come back later and see that it's changed. This is unacceptable in our society, and we want to create a watchdog service that monitors all published news articles for unannounced changes, and alerts subscribers.

Simple way to do A/B testing. Submit different URLs to test and create a basic task(s) for users. We then send users (filter by the demographic you want) to one of your URLs to try and complete the task and aggregate data to show which performed better. We could also create a system to create basic digital paper prototypes to then test those with users. A corporate edition would be available that integrates with your website and lets you do A/B testing with small areas on your website, i.e. buttons position, color, etc.

Translation game. Users can learn a language by translating sentences, and getting points for each word that matches what another user translated. For example, given the Chinese sentence “wo hen e”, someone might translate it as “I am hungry”, and another user would translate it as “I am very hungry.” Points would be assigned based on number of matching words and the most accurate translation would percolate to the top.

Track sources of pollution on a map. China leads the world in cancer deaths. These cancers are largely due to pollution. Nothing is being done about the pollution due to corruption and a desire for economic progress. The citizens of China need to have a way of holding companies accountable for the huge public health problems they are causing.
